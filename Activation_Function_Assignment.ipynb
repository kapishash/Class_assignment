Without activation functions, a neural network would be limited to linear transformations, as each layer would merely apply a weighted sum and pass it to the next layer without altering the data's structure. Here are the primary roles and significance of activation functions in hidden layers:\n",

        "1. Introducing Nonlinearity\n",
