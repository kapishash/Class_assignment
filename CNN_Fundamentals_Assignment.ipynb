        "   - **Pixels**: The smallest unit of a digital image. Each pixel holds color information that contributes to the overall appearance of the image.\n",
        "   - **Resolution**: The total number of pixels along the width and height of the image (e.g., 1920x1080). Higher resolutions mean more pixels, which allows for finer details.\n",
        "   - **Bit Depth**: Defines the number of possible intensity or color values a pixel can represent. For example:\n",

They are responsible for automatically learning and extracting spatial features from an input image. Each convolutional layer uses **filters** (or kernels) to detect patterns such as edges, textures, and more complex shapes as the network deepens.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Definition and Purpose of Convolutional Layers**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Convolutional Layers** apply a series of filters to the input data to create feature maps that highlight different aspects of the image, such as edges, textures, or shapes.\n",
        "   - The purpose of these layers is to detect spatial hierarchies of patterns at different levels—low-level features (like edges) in earlier layers and high-level features (like shapes or objects) in deeper layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Filters (Kernels) and the Convolution Operation**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Filters** are small matrices (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) with learned values that are applied across the input image or feature map to detect specific features.\n",
        "   - During the **convolution operation**, a filter slides (or convolves) over the input, multiplying each overlapping pixel value by the corresponding filter value and summing up these products. This results in a single value in the output feature map for each position where the filter is applied.\n",
        "   - **Feature Maps**: After each filter is applied, a feature map is generated, which represents the spatial location of detected features for that specific filter. Multiple filters in a convolutional layer allow the layer to detect different features in the same input.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**: A 3x3 edge-detection filter applied to an image will produce a feature map that highlights where edges are located in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Padding and Strides**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Padding**: Padding is the addition of extra pixels around the input image to control the spatial dimensions of the output feature map.\n",
        "     - **Same Padding**: Adds pixels (typically zeros) around the edges so that the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions as the input. This is useful to preserve information near the image edges.\n",
        "     - **Valid Padding**: No padding is applied, which causes the output feature map to shrink as the filter moves only within the bounds of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Strides**: The stride is the number of pixels the filter moves (or \"slides\") across the input each time.\n",
        "     - **Stride of 1**: Moves the filter one pixel at a time, which captures fine-grained details.\n",
        "     - **Stride of 2 or more**: Moves the filter by multiple pixels, reducing the feature map size, thus summarizing information at a larger scale but with less detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Impact on Output Size**:\n",
        "   - **Padding** helps maintain or control the size of the output feature map by managing the effective boundary of the convolution.\n",
        "   - **Strides** reduce the output size by a factor proportional to the stride value. For example, a stride of 2 halves the output size compared to a stride of 1.\n",
