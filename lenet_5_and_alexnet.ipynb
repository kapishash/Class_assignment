        "\n",
        "### Limitations of LeNet-5\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shallow Architecture:**\n",
        "   - **Limitation:** LeNet-5 consists of only three convolutional layers and two subsampling layers, making it relatively shallow compared to modern architectures. This limits its ability to learn complex features from more diverse and intricate datasets.\n",
        "   - **Impact:** The shallow depth restricts the model's capacity to capture hierarchical representations of data, which can lead to lower performance on more complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fixed Input Size:**\n",
        "   - **Limitation:** LeNet-5 was designed for fixed-size input images (32x32 pixels). It lacks the ability to handle variable-sized images effectively.\n",
        "   - **Impact:** This limitation reduces its applicability in real-world scenarios where input dimensions can vary widely, especially in more complex datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Limited Number of Filters:**\n",
        "   - **Limitation:** The number of filters used in LeNet-5 is relatively small (6 in the first layer and 16 in the second), which restricts the model’s ability to capture a wide range of features.\n",
        "   - **Impact:** This can result in poorer performance when dealing with large and complex datasets, as the network may not learn sufficiently detailed features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Dropout Regularization:**\n",
        "   - **Limitation:** LeNet-5 does not incorporate dropout or any form of regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "   - **Impact:** In situations with limited data, this can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Activation Functions:**\n",
        "   - **Limitation:** LeNet-5 primarily used sigmoid activation functions, which can suffer from issues like vanishing gradients.\n",
        "   - **Impact:** This can hinder the training of deeper networks, making it difficult to optimize weights effectively.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - **Benefit:** This deeper architecture allows for the learning of more complex features and hierarchical representations, significantly improving performance on challenging datasets like ImageNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variable Input Size:**\n",
        "   - **Advancement:** AlexNet can process images of various sizes through the use of padding and strided convolutions.\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This flexibility makes it applicable to a broader range of tasks and datasets with different input dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Increased Number of Filters:**\n",
        "   - **Advancement:** AlexNet employs many more filters in its convolutional layers (e.g., 96 filters in the first layer and 256 filters in subsequent layers).\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This allows the network to learn a richer set of features, enhancing its ability to recognize complex patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dropout Regularization:**\n",
        "   - **Advancement:** AlexNet incorporates dropout layers in its fully connected layers to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This improves generalization by randomly dropping units during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **ReLU Activation Function:**\n",
        "   - **Advancement:** AlexNet uses Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as its activation function, which alleviates the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This leads to faster convergence during training, enabling the model to learn effectively even in deeper architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Data Augmentation:**\n",
        "   - **Advancement:** AlexNet employs data augmentation techniques such as image translations, reflections, and cropping.\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This increases the effective size of the training dataset and helps improve model robustness, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
